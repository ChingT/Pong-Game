## Game flow

Pong is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle by moving it
vertically across the screen's left or right side. Players use their paddles to
strike a ball back and forth, and the objective is to score points by making the
ball pass the opponent's paddle. The game continues until one player reaches 5
points, making each match a dynamic and competitive challenge.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 Canvas:** The game utilizes the HTML5 canvas element to render the
  game graphics, providing a dynamic and interactive game environment.

- **JavaScript:** The game logic is implemented using JavaScript, including the
  rendering of elements, handling user input, and managing game mechanics.
